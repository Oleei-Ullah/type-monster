# TypeScript Exploration

## Overview
Welcome to my first TypeScript exploration! In this project, you'll dive into the world of TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language. This README will guide you through setting up your environment, understanding TypeScript basics, and exploring some advanced features.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js: [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager): Typically comes with Node.js installation
- TypeScript: You can install it globally via npm by running `npm install -g typescript`

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.

## Usage
### Running the TypeScript Compiler
To compile TypeScript code into JavaScript, run the following command in your terminal:


## TypeScript Basics
- **Type Annotations**: TypeScript allows you to specify types for variables, function parameters, and return types.
- **Interfaces**: Define the shape of objects in TypeScript using interfaces.
- **Classes**: Object-oriented programming is supported in TypeScript with classes, inheritance, and access modifiers.
- **Enums**: Create named constants in TypeScript using enums.
- **Generics**: Write reusable, type-safe code with generics.
- **Modules**: Organize code into reusable modules using TypeScript's module system.

## Advanced Features
Explore advanced TypeScript features such as:
- **Union Types**: Combine multiple types into one.
- **Intersection Types**: Create new types from existing ones.
- **Type Guards**: Narrow down types within conditional blocks.
- **Decorators**: Annotate and modify classes and class members.
- **Conditional Types**: Create types that depend on other types.
- **Type Inference**: TypeScript infers types based on context, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.
